Ordinary Differential Equations Manipulatives ("Mathlets")

This course employs a carefully developed set of dynamic computer applets called "Mathlets." They are used in lecture occasionally. Each problem set contains a problem based around one or another of them. ({{% resource_link d82413a8-26f3-8ed5-6f10-5da631b89646 "PDF" %}})

[The Mathlets Gallery](http://math.mit.edu/mathlets/mathlets/) can be found on the MIT Interactive Mathematics Site. Each Mathlet has an associated "Help" file which will open in a new window and provide user instructions.

Funding for the development of the Mathlets was provided by a grant from the [The d'Arbeloff Fund](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2000/darbeloff-1025.html) for Excellence in MIT Education as part of The d'Arbeloff Interactive Mathematics Project (d'A I M P).

Watch a [video](http://mathlets.org/training/introduction/) about the story behind the development of the Mathlets.
